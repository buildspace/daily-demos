# A video chat app using React and the Daily.co JavaScript API

This demo is meant to showcase a basic but complete video chat web app using React and the low-level Daily.co CallObject API. The CallObject API gives you direct access to the audio and video streams, letting you build your app however you'd like with those primitives.

Stay tuned for a thorough blog post walking through building this demo app!

For information on building and running this demo locally, see the [README at the root of this repo](../README.md).
