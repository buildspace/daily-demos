 * Create a short-lived room for demo purposes.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this is purely a "demo-only" API, and *not* how we recommend
 * you create rooms in real production code. In your code, we recommend that you:
 * - Create rooms by invoking the Daily.co REST API from your own backend server
 *   (or from the Daily.co dashboard if you're OK with creating rooms manually).
 * - Pass an "exp" (expiration) parameter to the Daily.co REST endpoint so you
 *   don't end up with a huge number of live rooms.
 *
 * See https://docs.daily.co/reference#create-room for more information on how
 * to use the Daily.co REST API to create rooms.
